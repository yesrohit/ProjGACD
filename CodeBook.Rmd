This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(data.table)
library(dplyr)

setwd("C:/Users/mittroh/Desktop/Data Science Course Track/GettingCleaningData_3/Course Project/UCI HAR Dataset/train")
```

Files X_train, subject_train.txt and y_train are loaded into dataframes using corresponding names and converted into dataframes. 


```{r}

## TRAINING DATA
Y_train = read.csv('y_train.txt', header = FALSE, col.names = "Activity")
subject_train = read.csv('subject_train.txt', header= FALSE, col.names = "Subject")
names <- read.csv("./../features.txt", sep="\n" ,header = FALSE, as.is = TRUE)
names = as.vector(names[,1])

X_train = read.table('X_train.txt', header=FALSE)
colnames(X_train) = as.vector(names)
```

Once the data is loaded, it is saved into a single dataset Trainset:
```{r}
TrainSet = cbind(subject_train,Y_train,Type="Train",X_train)

```


Similarly for the test dataset:
```{r}

##TEST DATA
setwd("C:/Users/mittroh/Desktop/Data Science Course Track/GettingCleaningData_3/Course Project/UCI HAR Dataset/test")
Y_test = read.csv('y_test.txt', header = FALSE, col.names = "Activity")
subject_test = read.csv('subject_test.txt', header= FALSE, col.names = "Subject")
names <- read.csv("./../features.txt", sep="\n" ,header = FALSE, as.is = TRUE)
names = as.vector(names[,1])
X_test = read.table('X_test.txt', header=FALSE)
colnames(X_test) = as.vector(names)
TestSet = cbind(subject_test,Y_test,Type="Test",X_test)
```

Finally, once the training and test datasets are prepared, they are combined using rbind:
```{r}
##TRAINING AND TEST DATASET
CompleteData = rbind(TrainSet, TestSet)
```

The combined dataset has more than 560 columns. Using grep function, column names containing the word 'mean' or 'std' are extracted. stdORmeanCol represent all these column numbers. This is then used to extract data from the combined dataset into a dataset called "CompleteDataSTD_MEAN"

```{r}
##COLUMNS HAVING STANDARD DEVIATION OR MEAN IN THEM
stdORmeanCol = c(grep("mean",colnames(CompleteData)),grep("std",colnames(CompleteData)))
CompleteDataSTD_MEAN = CompleteData[,c(1:3,stdORmeanCol)]
```

Next, we need to add descriptions for the activity type. This was found in the activity_labels.txt file. 
The descriptions were extracted and matched to the activity in the completeDataSTD_Mean[i,2]

```{r}
Activitynames <- as.vector(read.csv("./../activity_labels.txt", sep="\n" ,header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)[,1])
ActivityDescription <-numeric(0)

for(i in 1:length(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN[,1]))
    ActivityDescription[i] = Activitynames[as.numeric(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN[i,2])]

CompleteDataSTD_MEAN_ActDesc = cbind(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN[,c(1:3)],ActivityDescription,CompleteDataSTD_MEAN[4:dim(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN)[2]]) ##Add column of Activity Description next to the Activity column.
colnames(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN_ActDesc)
``` 


Finally, we group the data table by the subject and activity and find the mean for each of the mean/std variable and write it to the file "Final.txt""

```{r}

stdMeanDataTable = data.table(CompleteDataSTD_MEAN_ActDesc)

finalresult = datTabset[,lapply(.SD, mean), by=list(Subject,ActivityDescription), ]
setwd('./..')
write.table(finalresult, file="Final.txt", row.names=FALSE)


```
